## Documentation

A documentation on the background of this project, its API, and a step-by-step guide is available
[at Read the Docs](https://conflowgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Please check 
[in the background section](https://conflowgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background.html)
first whether ConFlowGen is the right tool for your purpose.

## User installation

Please just execute the following lines in a command line interface (CLI) of your choice (e.g., bash, PowerShell, or 
CMD).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1kastner/conflowgen
cd conflowgen
pip install --user .
```

After you have installed the library, you are ready to define your own scenarios and generate the data.

```python
import conflowgen
database_chooser = conflowgen.DatabaseChooser()
database_chooser.create_new_sqlite_database("new_example.sqlite")
...
```

The next steps from here are described
[in the docs](https://conflowgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo.html).
Examples how to generate synthetic data with ConFlowGen exist
[in the demo subdirectory](https://github.com/1kastner/conflowgen/tree/main/demo).
Additional use cases are presented
[in the example usage subdirectory](https://github.com/1kastner/conflowgen/tree/main/example%20usage).


## Development installation

For the development installation, instead of simply invoking `pip install` in the CLI in the project root folder, we 
additionally add the optional dependencies `dev` and `ui`.
Furthermore, an additional dependency on
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
exists.
The dependencies listed in `dev` allow us to run the unit tests and create the documentation.
The dependencies listed in `ui` allow us to create the visuals that are e.g. used when debugging probability-based 
unit tests or when creating visuals in Jupyter notebooks. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1kastner/conflowgen
cd conflowgen
pip install --user -e .[dev,ui]
```

After introducing the changed, you can run `run_ci_light.bat` on Windows.
It executes most of the continuous integration (CI) checks. 
On GitHub, these are implemented as GitHub workflows.
Once all jobs finish successfully, you can create a pull request if you would like to share your changes with the
ConFlowGen community.
You can also run the checks individually which is explained in the following.

### Run all tests

Set up your IDE to use `pytest` in the `tests` subdirectory (relative to the module root directory).
If you use an editor without test support, you can run `python -m pytest ./tests` in the module root directory as well.
Parallel test execution has not been tested and might not work.
If you prefer to also check the test coverage, you can run
`pytest --cov="./conflowgen" --cov-report html`
from the project root directory.
After the execution, the test coverage report is located in `<project-root>/htmlcov/index.html`.
Each new feature should be covered by tests unless there are very good reasons why this is not fruitful.

### Generate the documentation

For generating the documentation, 
[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
is used - mostly the default settings are maintained.
The documentation generation process is based on the sphinx boilerplate and the `make` process is unchanged.
To generate the documentation, move to the `docs` subdirectory (relative to the project root folder).
Here, as a Windows user you run `.\make.bat html` from the PowerShell or CMD.
Linux users invoke `make html` instead.
It is advised to use a strict approach by using the additional argument `SPHINXOPTS="-W --keep-going`
(see the corresponding
[GitHub CI pipeline](https://github.com/1kastner/conflowgen/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml#L34)
for reference).

### Checking the code quality

For checking the code quality, pylint and flake8 are used.
Pylint is run by executing `pylint conflowgen` on the project root level.
For flake8, simply invoke `flake8` at the same level.
