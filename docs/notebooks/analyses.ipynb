    "   Especially with a lot of input data, it might be tough to keep track of schedules and distributions.\n",
    "   Before using the generated data, cross-check the generated data with your input data.\n",
    "   Are the schedules honoured?\n",
    "   Do the empirical distributions in the generated data match your assumed distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Do the initial assumptions match?\n",
    "   It is tricky to assign containers to the vehicles on their outbound journey while adhering to distributions and operational constraints at the same time.\n",
    "   It is worthwhile comparing an analysis with its corresponding preview counterpart (if existent) to detect deviations between the two.\n",
    "   If they deviate largely and against your personal expectations, maybe the operational constraints need readjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Does the generated data correspond to your expectations?\n",
    "   Probably you used some of the default distributions and some you researched yourself.\n",
    "   You might want to cross-check the generated data with external data sources.\n",
