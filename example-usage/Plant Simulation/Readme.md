# Example Usage - Plant Simulation

The simulation model `Use ConFlowGen data as input.spp` is an example of how ConFlowGen data could be read in and used for simulation.
The model is created in Plant Simulation v16 with an academic license.
In the model, the Excel files are read in, vehicles are created, they visit the yard, deliver their containers, and pick up the containers for their outbound journey.
The interaction of the equipment and any kind of waiting times are completely neglected - this model is created to serve as a template for how ConFlowGen data could be used.
In other words, this is not a full-fledged example terminal.
